## Information
With this plugin you can allow your players to transfer between your server network with simplicity. **NaviCompass** is a plugin that uses **FormAPI** to easily display your servers and worlds listed in a simple UI. Its simple, all you need to do is enter the server IPs and Ports or your aliases for the worlds, along with a label to show up in the UI, all inside the config file. After that, the plugin will do the rest and you're good to go! Players will either have option to interact with the selector item (can be changed in the config.yml), or type */servers* in chat to get the server UI. Images can also be added via the config by simply using a link or a path to display an image with your server or world!

## Command
```diff
/servers → See your servers and worlds inside a UI!
```
