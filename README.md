## Information
With this plugin you can allow your players to transfer between your server network with simplicity. **NaviCompass** is a plugin that uses **FormAPI** to easily display your servers listed in a simple UI. Its simple, all you need to do is just enter the server IPs and Ports along with a label to show up in the UI, all inside the config file. After that, the plugin will do the rest and you're good to go! Players will either have option to interact with the selector item (can be changed in the config.yml), or type */servers* in chat to get the server UI.

## Command
```diff
/servers → See your servers inside a UI!
